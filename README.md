 Technologies Used:
Programming Language: 
   C: The entire system is implemented in C, making use of its standard libraries and functions.
Development Environment:
   - Any C-compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor (e.g., GCC, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio Code).
Standard I/O Library:
   - Utilizes `stdio.h` for input and output operations.
   - Utilizes `string.h` for string manipulation functions.

 Features:
Student Structure:
   - `id`: Integer to uniquely identify each student.
   - `name`: String to store the student's name.
   - `age`: Integer to store the student's age.
   - `grade`: String to store the student's grade.
   
Functionality:
   Add Student: Allows adding a new student if the limit (`MAX_STUDENTS`) is not reached.
  Edit Student: Enables editing the details of an existing student based on the ID.
  Delete Student: Allows deletion of a student record by ID, shifting subsequent records up.
